# phrase - the passphrase generator

`phrase` is a command-line tool to generate passphrases, that is
passwords made from random words.

## Origin of wordlists

The built-in wordlists (currently only german) come from these sources:

- [de](passphrase/de.txt): [bjoernalbers/diceware-wordlist-german](https://github.com/bjoernalbers/diceware-wordlist-german)
